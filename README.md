bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn jupyter
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook sample.ipynb
📈 Analysis Highlights
Dataset Overview
150 samples of iris flowers with 4 measurements each

3 species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica

No missing values detected

Key Findings
Species Characteristics:

Virginica has the largest overall measurements

Setosa has the smallest petal measurements but widest sepals

Versicolor shows intermediate measurements

Feature Correlations:

Strong positive correlation between petal length and width (0.963)

Moderate correlation between sepal length and petal measurements

Sepal width shows negative correlation with other features

Visualizations Created:

Line charts showing cumulative measurements over time

Bar charts comparing average measurements by species

Histograms displaying distribution of sepal length

Scatter plots exploring relationships between features

Correlation heatmaps

📊 Sample Output
The analysis generates multiple visualizations:

Composite Figure with 4 subplots:

Cumulative measurements over time

Average measurements by species

Distribution of sepal length

Sepal vs petal length scatter plot

Additional Visualizations:

Correlation heatmap

Petal width vs length scatter plot (strongest correlation)

💡 Business Implications
Petal measurements are the most reliable features for species identification

Automated classification systems should prioritize petal features

Quality control in botanical research can focus on petal dimensions

🧪 Running the Analysis
You can run the analysis in two ways:

Jupyter Notebook: Open sample.ipynb and run all cells

Python Script: The notebook can be exported as a Python script and run directly

To generate CSV outputs, uncomment the save_results() function call at the end of the notebook.
